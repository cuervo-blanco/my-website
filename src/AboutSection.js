        <p>
          I live in Queens, New York. I was raised in Jayuya, Puerto Rico. I
          graduated from a B.A. in Audiovisual Communications around 2018 from
          the UPR and I spent 3 Years in Cuba preparing myself as a Sound
          Professional for Film and Television. I've done almost everything in
          the Sound World, from Boom Operating to designing custom Audio
          Effects, but I have also had experience in the Camera, Production and
          Art departments. Which means that my capacitities are well-rounded and
          well-prepared for anything, because spontaneity is the nature of a
          movie set... On the other hand, I am a worker just like any other and
          I enjoy coming back home at the end of the day and being able to
          prepare me some nice food üçö üçï ü•ë Because when I'm not doing sound I
          love to cook, code websites (like this one) and enjoy music.{" "}
