          I'm very versatile when it comes to learning new tools. Heck, if it
          weren't for that curiosity that led me to read extensive manuals about
          equipment and specialized books on technology, I probably wouldn't be
          a Sound Person. My idea over the years has been to build a
          comprehensive skill set that would allow me to face any kind of
          situation. This meant learning CPR and First Aid, network-based audio,
          intercom systems, analog and digital mixers, open-source software, all
          kinds of DAWs, audio cleaning solutions, and video game-making
          software. I'm prepared for any kind of problem that presents itself,
          since after all, I am a problem solver. Technology is always new, but
          the basic building blocks remain the same, so if you don't see any of
          your favorite tools here, don't worryâ€”I will figure it out.{" "}
